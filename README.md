# PortQuiz
A very simple js tool for remembering ports for the CompTia A+ Core 1(1001) test and the Network+(007) test.  The N+ does not include ports that are on the A+ and not on the N+ objectives.

It's very simple.  I was just frustrated with how unhelpful flash cards were.  I'm very bad at javascript and just needed something functional to practice now matter where I was.

The site: 
A+: https://not-cool.neocities.org/typeletters.html
N+: https://not-cool.neocities.org/nplus/nplustypeletters.html

I don't pay for neocities so if that ever crashes, it's why I'm backing up the code here

Don't forget to change the website names if you use it.
